How to run single node test:

1. Make sure libfam-atomic1 and libfam-atomic1-dev packages are installed.

   # apt-get -y install libfam-atomic1
   # apt-get -y install libfam-atomic1-dev

2. Compile the fam_atomic_single_node_test.c program.

   # gcc -o fam_atomic_single_node_test fam_atomic_single_node_test.c -lfam_atomic

3. Run the program.

   # ./fam_atomic_single_node_test

4. Check that the test returned an exit code of 0. If so, the test was successful,
   else the test returned with an error. The test will also print a message about
   whether it completed successfully or that an error occurred.
