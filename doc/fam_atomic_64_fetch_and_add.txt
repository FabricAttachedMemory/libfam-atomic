SYNOPSIS
--------
        #include <fam_atomic.h>

        int64_t
        fam_atomic_64_fetch_and_add(struct fam_atomic_64 *address,

DESCRIPTION
-----------
        Given 'address', which is a pointer to a 64 bit fam atomic
        variable, reads the contents of the atomic variable, adds
        'increment' to the variable, and returns the original value
        that was read.
