NAME
----
        fam_atomic_128_compare_and_store - 128 bit fam atomic compare and store

SYNOPSIS
--------
        #include <fam_atomic.h>

        void
        fam_atomic_128_compare_and_store(struct fam_atomic_128 *address,
                                         int64_t compare[2],
                                         int64_t store[2],
                                         int64_t result[2]);

        cc ... -lfam_atomic

DESCRIPTION
-----------
        Given 'address', which is a pointer to a 128 bit fam atomic 
        variable, reads the contents of the atomic variable and
        checks if it is equal to 'compare'. If true, the variable gets
        set to 'store'. If false, the variable does not get modified.
        The original value that was read gets stored into 'result'.

	'compare', 'store,' and 'result' are all arrays of two
        64 bit integers representing 128 bit variables, where
        index [0] represents the first 64 bits and index [1] represents
        the last 64 bits.

        After calling this function, applications would typically
        check if 'result' is equivalent to 'compare' to verify
        if the operation succeeded.

RETURN VALUE
------------
        None, the previous value gets stored in 'result'.
