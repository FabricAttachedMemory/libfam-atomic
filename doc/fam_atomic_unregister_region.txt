NAME
----
        fam_atomic_unregister_region - unregisters FAM area with the library

SYNOPSIS
--------
        #include <fam_atomic.h>

        void
        fam_atomic_unregister_region(void *region_start,
                                     size_t region_length);

        cc ... -lfam_atomic

DESCRIPTION
-----------
	Unregisters an FAM area. This should be called on a region just
        before it gets unmapped if the region was previously registered
        with fam_atomic_register_region().

        Applications must unregister the exact region that was registered
        with fam_atomic_register_region(). The library does not support
        unregistering subsets or parts of a registered region.

        region_start: Pointer to start of region. Should match the value
                      given to fam_atomic_register_region() when the
                      region was registered.

        region_length: Size of the region to unregister.

RETURN VALUE
------------
        None
