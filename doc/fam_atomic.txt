NAME
----
fam_atomic - fabric attached memory atomic support library

SYNOPSIS
--------

Include the header file
....
#include <fam_atomic.h>
....

Register and unregister FAM areas with the library

....
	int
	fam_atomic_register_region(void *region_start,
				   size_t region_length,
				   int fd,
				   off_t offset);

	void
	fam_atomic_unregister_region(void *region_start,
				     size_t region_length);
....

Unpadded atomic operations. These are not cacheline aligned,
so care must be taken when using them to avoid accessing
memory within the same cacheline from the SoC without
performing the required cache flush and invalidate operations.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Fabric Attached Memory Atomics library provides a set of
primitives similar to the C11 atomics interfaces, but for memory
contained within a cache-incoherent fabric environment.

There are four operations available:

1. Fetch and Add. Read from the target address, stores the sum of that
value and a user-provided value and returns the original
value. Available for 32- and 64- bit values.

2. Swap. Read from the target address, write a user-provided value to
that address and return the original value. Available for 32-, 64- and
128- bit values.

3. Compare and Store. Read from the target address, if that matches
one user-provided value, store a second user-provided value. In any
case, return the original value. Available for 32-, 64-, and 128- bit
values.

4. Read. Reads from the target address, returning that
value. Available for 128- bit values. The fetch-and-add operation can
be used to perform this on 32- and 64- bit values by providing a 0
value.

All of these operations are atomic at the fabric level. None of them
perform any cache flushing or invalidation, so applications also
accessing the same cache lines directly must perform the necessary
cache invalidation and flushing operations.

Applications must take care when using these functions that either
all memory within the same cache line is accessed solely through
this atomics API or that the cache line is flushed before an atomic
operation and invalidated afterwards.

The atomic functions use virtual memory addresses to reference the
atomic objects. That address must be converted to an offset within a
specific file before being passed to the kernel. To perform this
conversion, the library needs to know the relationship between virtual
addresses and files. Applications must call fam_atomic_register_region
with the values from the mmap operation to set up this association
(see the example). When the region is unmapped,
fam_atomic_unregister_region must be called to clear this mapping.

For regions of memory mapped from files not
contained within fabric attached memory, these
atomic operations will be performed using the
C11 atomic operations so that applications can
use this library without regard to the
location of the storage.

To initialize a spinlock, assign the FAM_SPINLOCK_INITIALIZER.

EXAMPLE
-------

Here's a simple example which maps a new shelf in FAM to cover
a structure containing a 64-bit atomic and a spinlock. Then it
shows how to invoke some of the functions described above
while checking to make sure the library returns the expected values.
